									<h1>Nice Rebate</h1>
								</header>
								<p>I have been using this site for a number of weeks, I was pretty dubious at first as I thought it might be too good to be true but I can confirm this is a legitimate website, the only disadvantage I have noted is a 2-4% fee from PayPal when you receive the money back from Nice Rebate but they pay you a little extra to try and cover the fee. The only extra steps you have to complete is to review the product (doesn't have to be a 5 star), once you have reviewed the product on Amazon you simply wait for the review to become live (can take a few days) submit the Amazon review link on Nice rebate and within a day or two you receive the cost of the product back via PayPal.<p>
