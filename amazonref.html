												<p>I have been using this site for quite a while as well as testerjobs.uk The only disadvantage I have noted is a 2-4% fee from PayPal when you receive the money back from Nice Rebate but they pay you a little extra to try and cover the fee. <br/> Once you review the product <b>(doesn't have to be a 5 star)</b>, you simply wait for the review to become live (can take a few days), submit the Amazon review link on Nice rebate and within a day or two you receive the cost of the product back via PayPal.<p>
